create some components inside the SRC folder by creating a components folder
In the components folder create some components like article brand call to action or CTA component, Feature component and navbar component. Each component has a component file that is the JSX file. And also the CSS file.
import './article.css'
importing the CSS file helps in applying styles to the component.
Repeat the process for all the components. Create the JSX file and also the CSS file. And import the CSS file in the JSX file.
Components folder for small components.
Containers folder for large components.We have blog, features, footer, header, possibility and whatGPT3 containers
Create the JSX file and CSS file.Just like the components for each of the containers.
Insider app.We have a div.Inside that will include all the components and containers according to our layout.
